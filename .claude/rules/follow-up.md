# Agent Output Guideline

- After completing a task, rather than adding a `README` or `example` file, explain it.

- Do not rely on commands such as pnpm build or tsc to finish a task in one step. Instead, explain to the user where issues are likely to occur and what aspects of the project structure might cause them.
